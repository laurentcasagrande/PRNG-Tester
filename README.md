# PRNG Tester

PRNG Tester is a Python project designed to test and analyze the predictability of different pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) using a neural network model. This project uses various PRNG algorithms to generate datasets, trains a neural network on this data, and evaluates the performance of the model. This can be used to gage how good a given Pseudorandom number generator is.
